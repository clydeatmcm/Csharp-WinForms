### Workaround on CodeChum's Activity Issue

```bash
1. Create New Project
2. Select Windows Form App project template
3. Configure project with the following details
  3.1 Project Name: CodeChum
  3.2 Tick the box on "Place solution and project in the same directory"
4. Choose .NET 6.0 Framework. Download it using the link - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
5. In the Solution Explorer, right click CodeChum (with C# icon) then choose Add > Form (Windows Forms)...
6. In the Add New Item window, type the Name of the form's class as per CodeChum's instructions. 
  6.1 For example, In Topic 3 "C# WIndows Forms Labels" - HelloWorld Activity, use HelloWorld as the name of your new Form to be added.
  6.2 Then follow the rest of CodeChum's instructions
7. Once finished, close the solution and go to your project's directory then compress the entire folder
8. Proceed to CodeChum then submit.
9. If it fails, review the instructions and must follow all the details and check spelling errors then repeat step 8.
10. If it is ok, no need to create a new project, instead repeat step 5 and proceed to other activities.
